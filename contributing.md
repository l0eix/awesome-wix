# Contribution

There is two different option if you want to add new resources into this list:

1. You can create a PR (pull request) with the changes you've made. (Changes should align with the style of this file)
2. You can create an issue with required details and I can add it manually.

**When you are adding new resources follow these rules:**

- Add them into right category.
- Include name of resource with a valid URL.
- Include a short explanation of resource. What is it?
- Include name of resource owner (a person or a brand). `Made by <name-here>`
- Add content creator name with a URL in the end.
- Do not add any commercial resource (paid resources). Currently this list only include free resources.
